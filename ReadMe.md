UKMM Flash is a mod processing tool designed to make mod development quick and easy.
It uses U-King Mod Manager to quickly process the mod files in the background without any manual interactions.

It works by targeting a mod folder, which you can develop as you usually would. But when time come to test your changes, you just click the "Install & Deploy" button, and viola, your mod is updated in UKMM and deployed to your desired location!
